🧠**Welcome to my HackerRank 30 Days of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) Challenge repository! **
🎯This repo contains all my daily coding solutions and learning progress as I work through 30 problems designed to strengthen my programming, logic-building, and problem-solving skills.


🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The goal of creating this repository is to:

📘 Practice and master core DSA concepts through hands-on coding.

🧩 Develop consistent problem-solving habits by solving one problem every day.

💻 Build a personal codebase of well-documented solutions for future reference.

🌱 Track my growth and share my learning journey publicly on GitHub.

This repository serves as both:
A learning diary 📖, and
A reference collection for future DSA practice.

🏁 Goal
By the end of 30 days, the aim is to:

Solve all 30 problems with clear logic and explanation

Strengthen coding fundamentals

Develop optimized thinking for real-world problems

Build confidence for coding interviews and competitions
